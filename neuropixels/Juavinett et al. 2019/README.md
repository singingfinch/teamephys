The Neuropixel AMIE allows for chronic implantation and re-use of Neuropixels probes and recordings in freely moving mice.
There are three parts to the design: the internal mount, the external casing, and a stereotax adapter. All files are designed
in Solidworks (https://www.solidworks.com/). STL files are included for 3D printing. 

3D Printing
The internal mount (IM) and external casing (EC) can be printed at Shapeways: https://www.shapeways.com/

Machining
The stereotax adapter (SA) is machined from alumnium. We recommend machining the SA through protolabs: https://www.protolabs.com/
